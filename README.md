# VSThemeConverter 
 This is a CLI tool that takes in a VS Code themeâ€™s json file and converts it into a VS theme. 

 ## Using the tool 

1. Clone the repo and build the solution. 
2. Open command line in Admin mode. 
3. Go to the `vs-theme-converter\VSCodeThemeImporter\VSCodeThemeImporter\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1`. 
4. Run VSCodeThemeImporter.exe <theme_json_file_path> <vs_install_dir> 
5. For example, my command would be:  
`./VSCodeThemeImporter.exe "C:\Users\foo\Documents\Nord.json" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview" `
6. This command will launch a patched VS. You can select your new theme from the Tools -> Options -> General page. 
7. Play around with your theme and let us know what you think!
